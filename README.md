# Python-Projects
Python Projects with descriptions so others can benefit as well.
So I have been learning and doing small things (nothing consistent) in the area of Machine Learning particular Computer Vision applications for my PhD. However, I released soon enough that certificates and courses are mere "showcase" for your own shelves not for recruiters. Therefore, I decided to do "real-time" projects and these projects should reflect the skills and areas of my research or career I want to dwell in. But I decided to do a bit more this time, this time, I shall share my experiences and contribute back to society for two obvious reasons; teaching is the primary and most effective way of learning and secondly to reach out recruiters without letting them know (and hope you can do as well because together we shall succeed).
